When I was six years old I <mask>, once, a magnificent picture, in a book about the Virgin Forest which was called "Lived Stories."
It represented a <mask> snake that swallowed a wild animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
It was said in the <mask>: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing.
Then they can't <mask> move and they sleep for six months during their digestion."
I then thought a lot about <mask> the adventures of the jungle and, in turn, I managed, with a colored pencil, to draw my first picture.
My drawing number 1. It was like this:
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked them if my drawing scared them.
They <mask>: "Why would a hat scare anyone?"
My drawing did not <mask> represent a hat.
It represented a <mask> boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
I then drew the inside of the <mask> snake, so that the grown-ups could understand.
They always need <mask>.
My drawing number 2 was like this:
The grown-ups advised me to put aside the drawings of open or closed boa constrictors, and to focus on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.
Thus, I abandoned, at the age of six, a magnificent <mask> of a painter.
I had been discouraged by the failure of my drawing number 1 and my drawing number 2.
Grown-ups never understand anything on their own, and it is <mask> for children to always and always give them explanations.
So I had to choose another <mask> and I learned to fly airplanes.
I flew a little <mask> around the world.
And geography, indeed, was very useful to me.
I could recognize, at first <mask> glance, China from Arizona.
It is very useful if one is lost <mask> at night.
Thus, during my <mask>, I had many contacts with many serious people.
I lived a lot among the grown-ups. I saw them up close.
That did not improve my opinion too much.
When I met one who seemed a bit lucid to me, I tested them with my drawing number 1 which I have always kept.
I wanted to know if <mask> was really understanding.
But they always <mask>: "It's a hat."
So I wouldn't talk to them about boa constrictors, or virgin forests, or stars.
I put myself at their level.
I talked to them about bridge, golf, politics, and ties.
And the grown-up was very <mask> to know such a reasonable person.
